# Pattern Code and Explanation

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed explanation of a pattern code implementation in Java. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software development. Understanding and applying design patterns can lead to more efficient, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.

## Pattern Name
Singleton Design Pattern

## Problem Statement
In many scenarios, it's desirable to ensure that a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to that instance. This can be useful for managing resources, controlling access to shared data, or implementing caching mechanisms.

## Solution
The Singleton Design Pattern addresses the problem by ensuring that a class has only one instance and provides a way to access that instance globally. This is typically achieved by making the constructor private, providing a static method to access the instance, and lazily initializing the instance when it's first requested.

## Code Example
```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside
    private Singleton() {}

    // Static method to get the singleton instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    // Other methods and variables can be added here
}
